# Project: Spicy AI Content Creator Course Website

This project contains the complete source code and documentation for a static website designed to market and sell a course on creating AI-generated content with a 'spicy' or edgy theme.

## Project Structure

- `/index.html`: The main project hub, linking to all other parts.
- `/docs`: Contains all project documentation in Markdown format.
- `/wireframes`: Low-fidelity HTML wireframes for layout planning.
- `/prototype`: The final, high-fidelity interactive prototype built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This project is self-contained and requires no external dependencies to run. Simply open the HTML files in a web browser.
